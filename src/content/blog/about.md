I'm currently attending the **University of Texas at Austin**, where I'm studying **Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)**. I am part of the **[Longhorn Racing Electric](/timeline/lhr)** team, where I develop electrical systems for our Formula SAE electric race car.

Right now, I'm working at [**AMD**](/timeline/amd), gaining hands-on experience BIOS firmware engineering. This summer, I'll be joining [**Tesla**](/timeline/tesla) to further explore the intersection of hardware and software engineering.

## My Philosophy

I believe in the art of engineering, especially at the intersection of software and hardware. Modern technology holds transformative potential for the global economy, and I aim to be part of that change. For me, engineering isn't just about solving problems—it's about creating solutions that push boundaries and spark innovation.

I value decisive action and view failures as opportunities to grow. Business, to me, is not just about transactions; it's the pulse of innovation that drives us forward. While individual experience is essential, it's the collective knowledge of a team that reshapes industries and changes the world.
