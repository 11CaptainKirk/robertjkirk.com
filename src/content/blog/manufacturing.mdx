# Today

Manufacturing is undergoing a revolution. The rise of automation, artificial intelligence, and advanced robotics is transforming the way we make things. Factories are becoming smarter, more efficient, and more flexible.

Right now, most manufacturing processes are still largely manual.

## China

For some classes of products, China is the world's factory.
While develping [Neo](https://www.kryptonleds.com/) for my company [Krypton](/timeline/krypton), I had the opportunity to work with several Chinese manufacturers. The experience was eye-opening.

### Shenzhen Electronics Manufacturing

Shenzhen and the surrounding area is a hub for electronics manufacturing. Virtually anything can be made here, from simple PCBs to complex consumer electronics.
[Finding a manufacturer](/future), even without traveling to China, has never been easier.

### Industry 4.0

Industry 4.0 is the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of digital technologies into manufacturing processes. It encompasses a range of technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing. Industry 4.0 promises to revolutionize manufacturing by enabling real-time data analysis, predictive maintenance, and autonomous production.

## Security

Security is a critical concern in the manufacturing industry. For traditional manufacturing processes, security meant protecting physical assets and intellectual property. However, in the age of Industry 4.0, security has taken on a new dimension.

# Tomorrow

The future of manufacturing is exciting. Understanding where it's moving will be critical for companies to stay competitive. The convergence of digital technologies, advanced materials, and new production methods will create new opportunities and challenges.

### Automation

### Robots?
