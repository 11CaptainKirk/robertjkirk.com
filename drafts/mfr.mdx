Manufacturing is undergoing a revolution. The rise of automation, artificial intelligence, and advanced robotics is transforming the way we make things. Factories are becoming smarter, more efficient, and more flexible. All of this innovation means that the future of manufacturing and technology is bright.

# Today: Iteration at the cost of automation

Right now, most manufacturing processes are still largely manual. The aspirations of Industry 4.0 are just that - aspirations. The reality is that most manufacturing processes are still largely manual.

## China

For some classes of products, China is the world's factory.
While develping [Neo](https://www.kryptonleds.com/) for my company [Krypton](/timeline/krypton), I had the opportunity to work with several Chinese manufacturers. The experience was eye-opening.

### Shenzhen Electronics Manufacturing

Shenzhen and the surrounding area is a hub for electronics manufacturing. Virtually anything can be made here, from simple PCBs to complex consumer electronics.
[Finding a manufacturer](/future), even without traveling to China, has never been easier.

Many manufacturers will quote a price for virtually anything, regardless of their true ability to produce it.

They do have an ace up their sleeve, though: the flexible workforce. Humans can make almost anything happen.

### Manual Labor

Neo includes an injection molded plastic housing. The tooling for this was expensive.

Had I purchased the mold in the US, it would have been on the order of $30,000. In China, it was $3,000.

I would have expected the experience of working with the Chinese injection molding company to be difficult. I was surprised to find that it was not, and they were very eager to help me resolve production issues.

Perhaps it was the promise of high volume manufacturing or the cutthroat nature of the industry in China, but I found they were willing to do virtually anything to make me happy.

In one of the first iterations of the mold, the plastic was too thick in some areas, leading to pitting and a poor surface finish in general. In the US, the solution would have been to retool the mold, a process that would have taken weeks and cost thousands of dollars. At this factory, they offered to have a worker manually polish the surface of every part after molding. Presumably eventually they would have retooled the mold, but in the meantime, they were willing to do whatever it took to make me happy.

It's this flexibility that is not yet available with robots. While robots are great at repetitive tasks, they struggle with the flexibility and creativity that humans bring to the table.

The product development cycle requires this iterative process. While there are some products which can be perfectly set up for automated production, the vast majority of skus are at small enough scale that the effort to automate them is not worth it.

### Industry 4.0

Industry 4.0 is the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of digital technologies into manufacturing processes. It encompasses a range of technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing. Industry 4.0 promises to revolutionize manufacturing by enabling real-time data analysis, predictive maintenance, and autonomous production.

## Security

Security is a critical concern in the manufacturing industry. For traditional manufacturing processes, security meant protecting physical assets and intellectual property. However, in the age of Industry 4.0, security has taken on a new dimension.

# Tomorrow

The future of manufacturing is exciting. Understanding where it's moving will be critical for companies to stay competitive. The convergence of digital technologies, advanced materials, and new production methods will create new opportunities and challenges.

### Automation

### Robots?
